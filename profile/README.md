## Welcome to IDSL
IDSL Lab is a part of the Department of Electrical and Information Engineering at Seoul National University of Science and Technology, under the direction of Dr. Hyun Kim. We focus on implementing low-complexity multimedia processing and its applications through SoC designs and building hardware platforms that enable the artificial intelligence world. Also, computer architecture and memory systems for state-of-the-art technologies are included as main research interests.
